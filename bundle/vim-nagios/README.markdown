Nagios Vim Syntax
=================

Syntax file for Nagios in Vim. Forked from the [tejr/vim-nagios][1].

This allow me to change the ftdetect file because the location of our Nagios
configuration is located inside a SVN repository that contains sub-repositories:
dc\_features, dc\_global, dc\_local.
